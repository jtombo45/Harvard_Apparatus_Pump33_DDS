# Harvard Apparatus Pump 33 DDS Control

![Project Cover](./A_project_cover_image_for_"HarvardApparatusPump.png)

## ðŸš€ Overview
This project provides a **simplified, modular command-line interface** for controlling Harvard Apparatus syringe pumps using `pySerial`. Originally developed at **BIOXFEL**, this refactored code replaces a legacy, complex research script with a cleaner, more maintainable solution.

The program was designed to streamline experimental workflows involving precise fluid jetting from 3D printer nozzles. These studies aim to enhance control, accuracy, and efficiency in bio-physical processesâ€”contributing to advancements like improved drug production and next-gen 3D printing technologies.

## ðŸ§¬ About BIOXFEL
BIOXFEL leverages ultra-powerful lasers and cameras to study biological processes at atomic resolution without damaging samples. This project supported research focused on controlling liquid jetting mechanisms, paving the way for precision fluidics in scientific and industrial applications.
